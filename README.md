# Cylistic Case Study Analysis - Google Data Analytics Capstone
Welcome to my Cylistic Case Study project, an exciting endeavor as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate. This project offers a comprehensive exploration of bike-sharing trends using advanced data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, I embarked on an extensive analysis of bike-sharing data, employing a variety of tools and methodologies. The main aim was to extract meaningful insights and contribute to informed decision-making. The core focus of this project is the Cylistic Case Study provided within the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate.

## Data Source
The dataset utilized for this project is the Cylistic bike-sharing data, an essential resource provided as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate. This dataset contains critical information about bike rides, making it possible to uncover patterns and trends that hold potential for driving valuable business insights.

## Uploaded Files
The main branch of this repository includes the following files:
- **Descriptive Analysis on month data.sql**: This SQL script contains advanced analysis commands designed to unearth deep insights from the yearly data. Detailed explanations for these analyses can be found in the accompanying .pdf notes for Excel and SQL.

- **Create year data table using monthly data.sql**: This SQL script plays a pivotal role in the project by creating a table in BigQuery. This table forms the basis for subsequent analyses on yearly data, setting the stage for comprehensive insights.

- **Descriptive Analysis on yearly data.sql**: Building upon the table created in the previous SQL script, this file encompasses SQL commands for advanced descriptive analysis on yearly data. It aims to uncover trends and insights that span a broader timeframe.

- **Cyclist case study analysis using R.r** : In this R script, I ventured into more advanced analysis techniques. This involved creating visually compelling graphics to facilitate a deeper understanding of the data's nuances using the R programming language.

- **Notes for regenerating excel and sql analysis.pdf**: These meticulous notes provide step-by-step instructions for recreating the Excel and SQL analyses conducted throughout the project. They offer a comprehensive guide for those interested in replicating the analysis.

## Google Data Analytics Process
The project aligns with the Google Data Analytics process, which comprises the following phases:

- **Ask**: Defined relevant questions and objectives to guide the analysis.
- **Prepare**: Performed data cleaning and structuring for further exploration.
- **Process**: Executed data transformations, including creating the yearly data table.
- **Analyze**: Employed SQL and R for advanced analysis, generating insights.
- **Share**: Compiled key findings into a comprehensive presentation.
- **Act**: Transformed insights into actionable recommendations.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the uploaded files to gain insights into the analysis process. The .pdf notes provide detailed explanations for both the Excel and SQL analyses. The SQL scripts can be executed using your preferred SQL environment, and the R script requires R and RStudio.

Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to explore the realm of data analytics and extract insights that drive informed decisions together!
